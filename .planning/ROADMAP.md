### v3.3 Threat Map Dashboard (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Replace the dashboard with an enhanced threat map at /dashboard — existing map features preserved, new overlay panels for stats and indicators with toggle + peek-on-hover.

- [x] **Phase 37: Map Route Foundation** — Threat map renders at /dashboard with all existing widgets preserved (completed 2026-04-05)
- [x] **Phase 38: Overlay Panel Components** — Stat cards and indicators overlay the map with toggle control (completed 2026-04-05)
- [ ] **Phase 39: Peek-on-Hover Behavior** — Collapsed panels show edge slivers with independent hover reveal
- [ ] **Phase 40: Cleanup & Verification** — DashboardPage deleted, sidebar updated, zero dead references

## Phase Details

### Phase 37: Map Route Foundation
**Goal**: Users access the threat map as their main dashboard at /dashboard with all existing map features intact
**Depends on**: Phase 36
**Requirements**: LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-02, LAYOUT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User navigating to /dashboard sees a full-viewport threat map with live SSE feed, pulse markers, counters, donut, and countries widgets
  2. User navigating to /threat-map is redirected to /dashboard automatically
  3. All existing map interactions (click-to-pan feed entries, marker animations, connection status) work identically to the previous /threat-map page
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 37-01-PLAN.md — Route swap, redirect, and sidebar nav update
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 38: Overlay Panel Components
**Goal**: Users see threat database stats and recent indicators floating over the map with a toggle to collapse both panels
**Depends on**: Phase 37
**Requirements**: PANEL-01, PANEL-02, PANEL-03, TOGGLE-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees 7 threat database stat cards stacked vertically in a left overlay panel on top of the map
  2. User sees a scrollable recent indicators table in a right overlay panel on top of the map
  3. Both overlay panels have glassmorphism styling (semi-transparent background, backdrop blur, border) consistent with the design system
  4. User can click a single toggle button to collapse both panels simultaneously, and click again to expand them
  5. Clicks and scrolls inside overlay panels do not propagate to the map underneath
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 38-01-PLAN.md — Extract shared dashboard config to reusable module
- [x] 38-02-PLAN.md — Build overlay panels, toggle button, and wire into ThreatMapPage
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 39: Peek-on-Hover Behavior
**Goal**: Users can peek at collapsed panels by hovering edge slivers, with state persisted across refreshes
**Depends on**: Phase 38
**Requirements**: TOGGLE-02, TOGGLE-03, TOGGLE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees a thin peek sliver at the left and right edges when panels are collapsed
  2. User hovering over the left peek sliver reveals only the left panel; hovering the right sliver reveals only the right panel
  3. User's toggle state (expanded or collapsed) persists across page refreshes via localStorage
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 39-01-PLAN.md -- localStorage persistence, peek slivers, and hover-reveal� localStorage persistence, peek slivers, and hover-reveal
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 40: Cleanup & Verification
**Goal**: Dead code from the old dashboard is removed and navigation reflects the new structure
**Depends on**: Phase 39
**Requirements**: CLEAN-01, CLEAN-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. DashboardPage.jsx file is deleted and no import or reference to it exists anywhere in the codebase
  2. Sidebar navigation shows a single "Dashboard" link pointing to /dashboard (no separate Dashboard and Threat Map entries)
  3. A grep audit of the codebase confirms zero references to deleted files, old routes, or stale page title mappings
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 39-01-PLAN.md -- localStorage persistence, peek slivers, and hover-reveal� localStorage persistence, peek slivers, and hover-reveal
